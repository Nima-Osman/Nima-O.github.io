								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>For this activity, I chose to evaluate the security requirements of the GitHub API due to its popularity, 
									extensive documentation, built-in security features, and versatility. The GitHub API is widely used,
									 making it a relevant and practical choice for understanding and implementing security measures in 
									 data sharing, scraping, and connectivity between Python code and various file formats/management
									  systems (XML, JSON, and SQL) (Bansal, n.d.).</p>
								<p>An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of definitions and protocols that 
									enable communication between two software components. For example, a weather app 
									communicates with a weather bureau’s system to display updates on your phone. 
									APIs function through client-server architecture, where the client sends requests 
									and the server responds. There are various types of APIs, including SOAP, RPC, Websocket, 
									and REST, with REST being the most common. REST APIs operate over HTTP and are stateless, 
									meaning they do not store client data between requests. APIs offer benefits like integration, 
									innovation, expansion, and ease of maintenance. They can be public, private, partner, or composite,
									 depending on their use scope. API endpoints are critical for security and performance,
									  necessitating proper authentication and monitoring. Building an API involves planning, building, 
									  testing, documenting, and marketing it. API testing ensures functionality and security, 
									  while comprehensive documentation enhances usability. APIs can be found on marketplaces and 
									  directories, with API gateways managing multiple APIs efficiently. Tools like Amazon API Gateway 
									  and AWS AppSync facilitate API management and GraphQL API development (Amazon Web Services, Inc., n.d.).</p>
								<p>The GitHub REST API provides developers with the means to access and interact with GitHub 
									resources such as repositories, commits, and issues. To ensure secure data sharing, 
									scraping, and connectivity between a Python program and various file formats/management 
									systems like XML, JSON, and SQL, several security requirements must be met (Github, 2022).</p>	  
								<p>First, all API requests must be authenticated using OAuth tokens or personal access tokens. 
									These tokens should follow the least privilege principle, only requesting the necessary scopes 
									for the application to function. Tokens must be stored securely, avoiding hard coding them in 
									the source code. Adherence to GitHub’s rate limiting is crucial to prevent abuse and potential 
									denial of service. Implementing exponential backoff and retry logic can handle rate limits gracefully, 
									optimising the number of API calls made (Github, 2024).</p>
								<p>Encryption is vital for securing data transmission between the client and the GitHub API. 
									Using HTTPS for all API requests ensures data is encrypted, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. 
									Additionally, data validation and sanitisation are necessary to prevent injection attacks. 
									Utilising libraries and frameworks that offer built-in data validation and sanitisation, 
									along with regularly updating dependencies, helps mitigate these risks.</p>
								<p>Robust error handling is essential for managing API errors effectively. 
									Logging errors for debugging purposes without exposing sensitive information 
									and providing meaningful error messages ensures the application can recover from errors. 
									Controlling access to sensitive data and operations through proper access control mechanisms 
									is another critical aspect. Using GitHub’s API access control features helps limit 
									actions based on user roles and permissions, ensuring only authorised users can perform 
									critical operations.</p>
								<p>Monitoring and auditing API usage can detect and respond to potential security incidents. 
									Using GitHub’s audit logs and third-party monitoring tools to track API usage and detect anomalies, 
									setting up alerts for unusual activities, or potential security breaches is recommended (GitHub Docs, n.d.). </p>
								<p>When dealing with data formats such as XML, JSON, and SQL, specific security considerations 
									should be taken into account. For XML, it is essential to ensure proper parsing to prevent XML 
									External Entity (XXE) attacks, using libraries that disable external entity processing. 
									For JSON, validating and sanitizing data prevents injection attacks, and secure parsing methods 
									should be employed. For SQL, parameterized queries must be used to prevent SQL injection, 
									and the database should be secured with proper access controls.</p> 
								<p>By adhering to these security requirements, risks associated with using the GitHub API for 
									data sharing, scraping, and connectivity in a Python application can be mitigated. 
									Proper authentication, encryption, validation, access control, and monitoring are critical 
									components to ensure the secure use of the API.</p>

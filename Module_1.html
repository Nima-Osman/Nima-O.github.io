								<h3>Collaborative Dicussion 1 summary</h3>
								<p>Learning outcomes:</p>
								<p> <li>Demonstrate a critical awareness of roles and responsibilities (
									legal, ethical, social and professional) of a Data Science professional.
									</li></p>
								<p> <li>Critically analyse architecture, 
									design, development methodology, querying and the lifecycle of
									 managing large-scale datasets.</li></p>
								<p>Feedback</p>
								<p>The review is comprehensive. Demonstrates broad insight of the opportunities and 
									challenges that lays ahead of the Data Scientist. There is evidence of detailed 
									understanding of the issues. There is consideration and analysis of the diverse views in respect of  
									emerging and future trends of the Data Scientist and how the role should adapt to market demands in order
									 to continue its relevance. Mentioned is made of how integrating citizen technology models could influence 
									 our understanding for future direction. Initial posts generates immense interest followed with comments. 
									 This is strong evidence of the impact of the initial posts. Engages very well with peers with by responding
									  comments on initial post. This is excellent. 

									The presentation of this work is very good and shows a well organised
